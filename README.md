# ce888project

This folder contains the documents for the project proposal of the CE888 module.

The folder 'Datasets' contains two datasets: 'GeoOrigin' and 'default of credit card clients', the third dataset for the proposal is too big to be commited, but can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD.

The PDF file 'CE888 Assignment 1' contains the project proposal, a Gantt chart for the development of the project and a copy of the propotype code.

The Untitled.ipynb file is a python notebook that contains a copy of the prototype code for the project. It can be used for any dataset, but the name of the input file has to be changed.
It must be noted that as it is a protoype code, some issues can appear when implementing it, its objective is to be a reference for writing a fully operational code.
